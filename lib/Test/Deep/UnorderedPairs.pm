=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides the sub C<unordered_pairs> (and C<tuples>, as a synonym)
to indicate the data being tested is a list of pairs that should be tested
where the order of the pairs is insignificant.  This would be equivalent to
testing the list is as if it were a hash.

This is useful when testing a function that returns a list of hash elements as
an arrayref, not a hashref.  One such application might be testing L<PSGI>
headers, which are passed around as an arrayref:

    cmp_deeply(
        $response,
        [
            '200',
            unordered_pairs(
                'Content-Type' => 'text/plain',
                'Content-Length' => '12',
            ],
            [ 'hello world!' ],
        ],
        'check headers as an arrayref of unordered pairs',
    );

Pass an (even-numbered) list of items to test

=item * C<tuples>

C<tuples> is an alias for C<unordered_pairs>.  I'm open to more names as well;
I'm not quite yet sure what the best nomenclature should be.
